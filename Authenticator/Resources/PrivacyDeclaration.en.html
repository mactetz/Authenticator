    <h1>Privacy declaration Authenticator for Windows</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
        This is the privacy declaration of Authenticator for Windows. With all respect for your privacy, we try to limit the required data to a minimal amount. We always adhere to the rules set by the Data Protection Act. For all permissions the app uses, we explain why it's being used.
    </p>
    <p>
        This statement may be amended unilaterally at any time.
    </p>
    <h2>Camera</h2>
    <p>
        The camera in your device can be used to scan codes. While scanning, there will be searched for a QR code to read. This will always be processed locally and will NEVER be sent over the internet.
    </p>
    <h2>Internet connection</h2>
    <p>
        Your internet connection is being used to retrieve the most precise time from an NTP server and for cloud synchronization. You can turn this off at any time to prevent data usage.
    </p>
    <h2>OneDrive storage</h2>
    <p>
        Optionally you can turn on cloud synchronization to synchronize your accounts between all your Windows devices. This uses your internet connection and your OneDrive storage. Your accounts in the cloud are being encrypted with your personal key to guarantee your safety.
